## Identify the need for a Community of Practice
The need for a Community of Practice can come from two main sources:
* Some leadership body (say, the PDLT) can identify a need for a Community of Practice
* A self-organising group can identify a need and propose the need for a Community of Practice

It’s worth getting informal validation of the idea (I.e. talk to people) before going much further.

## Articulate the need for a Community of Practice 
For Redgate to fully support a Community of Practice, it’s important to present why that community is valuable to Redgate.
This information should be collated into a Community of Practice one-pager:

### Identified leaders 
For a community to be successful, it needs identified leaders who take responsibility for the health of the group.
These leaders should have identified responsibilities and should embrace peer-to-peer accountability for them. 

### A mission 
We need to know why this community exists; the value it wants to bring to Redgate. 
This should be a long-lived mission statement. 

### A current objective 
A community should know the change it is currently trying to make towards that mission. 
This should take the form of an Objective and Key Results and should be regularly reviewed/updated. 
### A sponsor 
If communities are to shape how Redgate operates, it’s important they’re aligned with the company. That’s why it’s important for someone senior in Redgate to agree a community is valuable. 

This sponsor should be someone in management, like a divisional lead or member of the exec team. They don’t need to be actively involved in the community,  

## Getting Sponsored
For a Community of Practice to do more than run  learning & development activities, they will need a sponsor;  someone representing company leadership or management who agrees with the value the community is trying to provide.

### What does a sponsor do?
A sponsor will:
* Hold community leaders accountable for progress towards their objectives
* Be an ally for the community when they want to make significant changes at Redgate
A sponsor can be an active part of a community, or even a community leader, but this isn’t required.

### How to get a sponsor
When you have a “Communities of Practice one-pager", you should be able to pitch to a suitable leadership group for support. If that group is in favour of the community, then either one of that group volunteers to be the sponsor, or they recommend another senior person to approach.
[Need to flesh out who a “suitable leadership group  ” is, and how the pitch happens   .]

### What if we don’t get a sponsor? 
Getting a sponsor for a community shouldn’t be taken for granted. Sponsorship is a commitment from both sides.
If nobody is willing to sponsor your community now, they should be able to articulate why. This may be because:
* It’s not aligned with Redgate’s needs
* They’re not willing to commit people’s time to it right now
* There are concerns with the community proposal that need addressed.

Take any feedback onboard and see if you’d like to revise your suggested community and ask for a sponsor again. Existing community leads should be able to provide guidance and support with this.

You may still be able to run learning & development activities around a topic, if you have an audience and access to things like 10% time.

## Expectations
