# What’s a Community of Practice?
Communities of Practice are a collective of Redgaters who are dedicated to improving how part of Redgate operates.

That may include:
* Providing leadership/direction in a particular area
* Understanding and setting policy
* Addressing a challenge that cannot (or does not) get prioritised in “business as usual”

These challenges may be long or short-lived.

Communities of Practice will often be cross-functional, depending on the needs of the challenge they’re tackling.
