# Getting Sponsored
For a Community of Practice to do more than run  learning & development activities, they will need a sponsor;  someone representing company leadership or management who agrees with the value the community is trying to provide.

## What does a sponsor do?
A sponsor will:
* Hold community leaders accountable for progress towards their objectives
* Be an ally for the community when they want to make significant changes at Redgate
A sponsor can be an active part of a community, or even a community leader, but this isn’t required.

## How to get a sponsor
When you have a “Communities of Practice one-pager", you should be able to pitch to a suitable leadership group for support. If that group is in favour of the community, then either one of that group volunteers to be the sponsor, or they recommend another senior person to approach.
[Need to flesh out who a “suitable leadership group  ” is, and how the pitch happens   .]

## What if we don’t get a sponsor? 
Getting a sponsor for a community shouldn’t be taken for granted. Sponsorship is a commitment from both sides.
If nobody is willing to sponsor your community now, they should be able to articulate why. This may be because:
* It’s not aligned with Redgate’s needs
* They’re not willing to commit people’s time to it right now
* There are concerns with the community proposal that need addressed.

Take any feedback onboard and see if you’d like to revise your suggested community and ask for a sponsor again. Existing community leads should be able to provide guidance and support with this.

You may still be able to run learning & development activities around a topic, if you have an audience and access to things like 10% time.
