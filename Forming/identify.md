# Identify the need for a Community of Practice
The need for a Community of Practice can come from two main sources:
* Some leadership body (say, the PDLT) can identify a need for a Community of Practice
* A self-organising group can identify a need and propose the need for a Community of Practice

Itâ€™s worth getting informal validation of the idea (I.e. talk to people) before going much further.
