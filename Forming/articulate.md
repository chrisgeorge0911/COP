# Articulate the need for a Community of Practice

For Redgate to fully support a Community of Practice, it’s important to present why that community is valuable to Redgate.
This information should be collated into a Community of Practice one-pager:

## Identified leaders 
For a community to be successful, it needs identified leaders who take responsibility for the health of the group.
These leaders should have identified responsibilities and should embrace peer-to-peer accountability for them. 

## A mission 
We need to know why this community exists; the value it wants to bring to Redgate. 
This should be a long-lived mission statement. 

## A current objective 
A community should know the change it is currently trying to make towards that mission. 
This should take the form of an Objective and Key Results and should be regularly reviewed/updated. 
## A sponsor 
If communities are to shape how Redgate operates, it’s important they’re aligned with the company. That’s why it’s important for someone senior in Redgate to agree a community is valuable. 

This sponsor should be someone in management, like a divisional lead or member of the exec team. They don’t need to be actively involved in the community,
