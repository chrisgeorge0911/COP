# Initial Recruitment

Communities of Practice will typically need more than just leaders to be successful, so much recruit. This will typically involve a public call-for-interest, with a degree of headhunting.

“Recruits” will need to be able to commit time to a Community of Practice. This is a discussion they will need to have with their line manager before putting themselves forward.

Some Communities of Practice will arise from self-organised groups, so will already have “recruits”. This may be enough, or there may be need for wider recruitment.
