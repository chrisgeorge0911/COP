# Why form a Community of Practice?

Redgate actively encourages professional development, with programs like Down Tools Week and 10% time. Why are Communities of Practice important alongside this? important alongside this?

## Making greater progress than you can on your own

We do our best work in teams isn’t a company value without good reason! A well-led group of committed individuals can achieve far more together than they can on their own.

## Recognition for leadership

Redgate invests heavily in personal development and works hard to acknowledge peoples’ achievements.

Leading a community is an opportunity to develop real, demonstrable leadership skills as part of your personal development.

## Ability to spin up initiatives outside 10% time

For a community to really influence how Redgate works, it can’t be limited to 10% time.

An effective community should be able to make extra time for improvement work, through ongoing initiatives or spinning up timebox teams.

## A voice into planning

Some improvement initiatives may be too large to build in to how we already work.

If a community identifies a significant challenge or opportunity for Redgate, we should find ways to feed this into Redgate’s priorities as a company.

## Access to a budget

Redgate has a modest budget for communities to spend.

This can be used to promote the communities themselves, internally and externally, and to find ways to bring new ideas into Redgate.
